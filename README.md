# NetControlApp 


Improvements:

•	Add the possibility for more users to see an analysis.


Known bugs:

•	The nodes are not correctly loaded if the network is given as seed nodes.

Team 3:

•	Still show partial results for stopped analysis

•	Maybe also make it able to restart – Feature to be considered at the end if there is time – Controller and Thread

•	Results are visual or XML? --- XML

•	Is it optimal to have 1 object per edge and can it scale with large graphs?? - edges can be strings and you take them 2 by 2

• It should work on a cluster or at least many threads. Check the environment available and then adapt to the resources. 


Team 1:

•	Cookies terms(GDPR)

•	Team 3 requires reinforcements. They have a snake problem with Pythons and Sharp C’s.


Team 2:

•	ViewAnalysis page:

  o	Sending e-mail should be by default (every 24 hours after Analysis started) + at the end ---- Don't even ask 

  o	More informative about the type of Heuristics used
  
  o	Separate different types of data (user data, technicalities, etc.)
  
  o	Add download button
