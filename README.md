# NetControlApp 


Improvements:

Team 3:

•	Still show partial results for stopped analysis

•	Maybe also make it able to restart – Feature to be considered at the end if there is time – Controller and Thread

•	Results are visual or XML? --- XML

•	Is it optimal to have 1 object per edge and can it scale with large graphs?? - edges can be strings and you take them 2 by 2

• It should work on a cluster or at least many threads. Check the environment available and then adapt to the resources. 

Team 1:

•	Facebook Login (sms or credit card). 

•	Cookies terms(GDPR)

•	Google and Microsoft uses Sadra’s E-mail. Should be switched to Combio’s E-mail – created by Team 1

•	Team 3 requires reinforcements. They have a snake problem with Pythons and Sharp C’s.


Team 2:

•	ViewAnalysis page:

  o	Starting time instead of just Time
  
  o	Only show the number of Nodes and targets but the list itself is on a new page through a button
  
  o	Checkboxes should be Yes/No
  
  o	Sending e-mail should be by default (every 24 hours after Analysis started) + at the end ---- Don't even ask 
  
  o	Delete the Drop-Down boxes, just show values
  
  o	Status should explain more than just True/False
  
  o	Too-long text on left column should be displayed 
  
  o	Delete button should only act for Completed ones
  
  o	Different color for stopped analyses
  
  o	More informative about the type of Heuristics used
  
  o	Separate different types of data (user data, technicalities, etc.)
  
  o	Add download button
  
  o	Big boxes should tell you more than just hit you with a time and name of algorithm without background 
  
  o	Maybe just show the date on the big boxes
